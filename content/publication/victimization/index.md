abstract: "We study the effect of a victimization narrative on national identity and public opinion in China using an experimental approach. Previous studies suggest that governments can guide public opinion by shaping citizens' collective memory on historical events, but few establish a causal linkage. By conducting an online survey experiment among approximately 2,000 urban Chinese citizens, we examine the causal impact of primes of historical narratives on political attitudes. We find that, compared with control conditions, a narrative focusing on Chinaâ€™s humiliating past in late Qing significantly reinforces respondents' attachment to the victim side of the Chinese national identity, raises suspicion of the intention of foreign governments in international disputes, stimulates preference for more hawkish foreign policies, and strengthens support for China's current political system. The effects are considerably stronger among respondents without a college degree and those with weaker nationalistic predispositions."
