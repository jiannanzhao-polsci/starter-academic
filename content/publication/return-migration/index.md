abstract: "How does migration affect people’s political efficacy and participation in autocracies? Existing studies focus on the socioeconomic aspect of migration; instead, we examine the political impact. We argue that migrants gain political efficacy through migration experiences because they learn more about the bureaucratic system from frequent interactions with the government. When migrants return to original communities, their heightened political efficacy motivates them to participate more than non-migrants in local politics. We test this argument by leveraging large-scale migration and return in rural China. Using four nationally representative surveys spanning from 2006 to 2014, we find that returning migrants are more confident in their ability to influence political outcomes. However, their increased political efficacy does not lead to higher levels of participation in local politics. We present suggestive evidence that returnees’ altered trust and preference for government intervention may explain the paradox of stronger political efficacy and less political participation."
